* one question is how easy it is to extend CityGML to handle some of
  the attributes that it currently doesn't handle vs. GIS attributes
  vs. something like create an LOD5 model.  Jon has been in touch with
  BIM Server and also wants to talk with the people at FME to see if
  they can get in touch with them.

* How much should we be looking at Galdos?  Have Arianne talk with
  them.  

* There is a handful of papers of people looking at this and figuring
  out how to address it.  Sheryl and Jon can send some papers to help
  us make some progress.

* Want to make some progress on comparing FME to BIMServer

* Also can look at the sketchup stuff would be good - want to see what
  gets lost, what doesn't get lost, how do you handle it, etc.

* Older Revit models create bigger problems for IFC exporting

* On getting more data:
  - There are some things that need to be taken care of to get things
    working the database as far as user management is concerned.  It's
    in Oracle.   

  - Jon will be talking with people to get some more data to
    use/transfer. 

* How do we get Arianne access to ArcGIS?

* Cloverpoint has a daily updated GIS data, but we have the 3D model
  but don't have their GIS data.  It belongs to C&CP.  Jon will be
  talking with Jeff Burton about this, so need to figure out where we
  get the access to the data from.

* There are lots of problems with roundtripping within Revit even

* Define what are the different exports we want to look at, and then
  how do we rigorously evaluate all of the transformations.  Plot
  where the different file formats fit into the different parts of the
  overall picture (Jon will send me the picture).

* Figure out what the different file formats are and what they look
  like and put it on the picture.  Look at what were the design
  artifacts available during the energy charrette.  One question is
  where to get the data.  Sheryl will get some data.  Arianne can ask
  a friend who worked with the engineering firm for Pharmacy to find
  out.  Jon can talk to some people about it as well.

* Look into what the buzzsaw data is, Alberto may have access to some
  of these other models

* There's a dropbox folder for CIRS retrospective done by Paul and
  Laura, but there may not be a lot of design data around that.

* Look at which way the exports work and the imports work, etc.

* Lan, Arianne, and I look into what Galdos does and then write up
  some mail about where we are and what we're trying to do and send
  them mail (after sending mail to Sheryl to check for stupidity).
  Want to know how Galdos would fit into that stream.

* Need to know what information gets lost in each of the steps -
  perhaps with the difference between FME, BIMServer, and Galdos.

**********************************************************************

Cloverpoint

* Need to know if it's access to the published services (which is what
  we do).  Jeff would not be the right person, would need Campus and
  Community planning. Lisa Colby is the client, but she's given
  permission already, so we work with her to make sure that they agree
  that it's going to be okay for us to have access - she'll probably
  point us at Ellen, so that's fine.  They were waiting until they'd
  released the last version.

* Would be curious to see what facilities has (related to the meeting
  that I had with Brent Sauder)

* The data that C&CP has is cleaned

* Should check to see if the C&CP people would be interested in having
  the converted buildings into CityGML, and then try to feed it back
  into the system (the Cloverpoint people are interested in it).
  Thinks it would be nice to have a central repository of the data
  (presumably in cloverpoint 

* Need to know the LIDR information and see what LOD we have the data
  in.

* They bet that the problem with the Pharmacy building is a facing
  issue with the normals, since Revit doesn't deal with normals.

* They find that the sketch up stuff is a problem because it will
  display it but not understand and then won't manage to export.  They
  inherit the 0, 0, 0 from the other system, but they don't have the
  actual information

* They have a bunch of scripts for exporting that they may be able to
  share with us, if Arianne or Lan run into problems, should talk to
  them.

* Would like to know when they're showing off the cloverpoint stuff in
  the decision theatre so that they can see what's happening.

* they haven't tapped into data in terms of what's related to internal
  spaces or basements, or anything sub-surface, or having more dynamic
  data, like where do people actually hang out, things like tweet heat
  maps, geospatial data.  They're doing a lot through mapsocial.

* They have real time data integrated with facebook.  Would like to
  figure out how to bring this real time data into something that's
  more interesting than "we created it, come see."
